      <h1>Returning to San Francisco after seven months in Asia</h1>
      <p>This is a very exciting year for me. I am finally leaving behing the giant corporations after almost six years of working in finance. I've set my sights on the startup world to learn about taking an idea and building a company around it. I've spend the last seven months living in Singapore, Bangalore, and traveling the world. It's been exciting, but it's time to buckle down and start the next chapter of my career.</p>

      <h2>Current Location: Luang Prabang, Laos</h2>
      <p>Today, I am writing from the quaint city of Luang Prabang, Laos. A quiet city with a relaxed nature and a delightful French influence. I arrived just at dawn to see a procession of monks walking around the village asking for food, a daily ritual.</p>

      <p>Among other places that I have visited recently are <a href="">Istanbul, Turkey</a>, the true East meets West, and the sultry statues of <a href="">Khajuraho, India</a>. Check out other pictures on my Google+ account.</p>

      <h2>Quirks and Cubes!</h2>
      <p>Last year, I learned to solve the Rubik's cube, and since then I've been hooked. I can solve a 2x2x2 through 5x5x5 Rubik's cube and a 4x4x6 cuboid. My personal best for the classic 3x3x3 cube is 26.99 seconds! Like programming, cubing requires a lot of algorithms and logic. My love of logic games and puzzles is one reasons I started to look into DevBootcamp in the first place.</p>
